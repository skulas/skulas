Office Add-In:

. Sync issue. Upload works only on debug mode
. Get all slices into single bytearray before transmit
(look here for idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39695223/how-to-upload-a-local-word-docx-file-on-server-using-javascript)
. Fix filename through http headers if working with bytearray
. Fix crash after upload complete

. Do Post from form with input of type file (after fix of host: 0.0.0.0)
Then do multipart upload instead post of bytearray



Response should log all files uploaded


Tests:
1. No file / blank file / new file
2. Word and Excel
3. Upload same file / file with same name many times.
4. Test large files
5. Unsaved changes. NEED TO DEFINE BEHAVIOR.
