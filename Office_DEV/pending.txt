Office Add-In:

. Sync issue. Upload works only on debug mode
. Get all slices into single bytearray before transmit
(look here for idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39695223/how-to-upload-a-local-word-docx-file-on-server-using-javascript)
. Fix filename through http headers if working with bytearray
. Fix crash after upload complete

. Do Post from form with input of type file (after fix of host: 0.0.0.0)
Then do multipart upload instead post of bytearray


Response should log all files uploaded

Check if office addin has key store (remembers username password)
Check if office plugin host and edge share the same key store (or password store) - 


VSTO

Save To Dokka Button:
1. Location of buttton to be defined ***
2. This button uploads any file to dokka, regardless the filename.
3. If no filename, use NONAME_YYYY_MM_DD__HH_mm



Flow:
FIXED 1. User logs in and gets token.
FIXED 2. Upload is done with token.
FIXED 3. >>>> YES, upload after successful login: SHALL DO UPLOAD AFTER LOGIN?? CURRENTLY DOES LOGIN OR UPLOAD UPPON SAVE.
4. Need to persist username/password. No built in solution in windows such as keychain in mac.
5. Need to define together with Arik / Emil a way to validate file-token vs file-name vs client. 
	This way users cannot just edit the filename and upload another file just because it matches the regexp
6. *** MUST ***: Remove extra row added uppon upload for debug
FIXED 7. Need to login again if Token expired.
FIXED 8. Perist Token between Excel executions??
9. Implement same for Word. MINIMAL boilerplate.
10.Test alternatives to the saved copy path (currently doing in same folder as original document)
FIXED 11.Should delete the copy created for upload.
IT'S OK :: 12.Server is using stub with Dummy token for login. Need to define logic with Arik / Emil.
FIXED 13.Save as opens the copy.

13. ERROR Handling. Currently there's no information displayed to the user regarding problems detected by the system. **TBD
14. INSTALL / Deployment method.
15. Show user messages about result of actions? (Upload fail / finish, Save upload fail/finish, etc...) **TBD

**** ASK FROM ARIK *** Upload Api and Login Api
Two login steps:
1.
email: account1@dokka.me
pwd: qwerty1

2.
use token from first login
t1Token: Token
email: company.email9@foo.com



File Format:
Dokka#managed#file_mashebali_0123456789_configString


Dokka GIT repo token:
c82b9267b4101dc0eafb3c2cfcd8f3b68b838179


Tests:
1. No file / blank file / new file
2. Word and Excel
3. Upload same file / file with same name many times.
4. Test large files
5. Unsaved changes. NEED TO DEFINE BEHAVIOR.
6. Save uppon close app, check if upload succeeds
7. Check files with different names and valid and not valid dokka format.
