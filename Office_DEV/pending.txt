Office Add-In:

. Sync issue. Upload works only on debug mode
. Get all slices into single bytearray before transmit
(look here for idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39695223/how-to-upload-a-local-word-docx-file-on-server-using-javascript)
. Fix filename through http headers if working with bytearray
. Fix crash after upload complete

. Do Post from form with input of type file (after fix of host: 0.0.0.0)
Then do multipart upload instead post of bytearray


Response should log all files uploaded

Check if office addin has key store (remembers username password)
Check if office plugin host and edge share the same key store (or password store) - 


VSTO

Save To Dokka Button:
1. Location of buttton to be defined ***
2. This button uploads any file to dokka, regardless the filename.
3. If no filename, use NONAME_YYYY_MM_DD__HH_mm



Flow:
FIXED 1. User logs in and gets token.
FIXED 2. Upload is done with token.
FIXED 3. >>>> YES, upload after successful login: SHALL DO UPLOAD AFTER LOGIN?? CURRENTLY DOES LOGIN OR UPLOAD UPPON SAVE.
4. Need to persist username/password. No built in solution in windows such as keychain in mac.
5. Need to define together with Arik / Emil a way to validate file-token vs file-name vs client. 
	This way users cannot just edit the filename and upload another file just because it matches the regexp
6. *** MUST ***: Remove extra row added uppon upload for debug
FIXED 7. Need to login again if Token expired.
FIXED 8. Perist Token between Excel executions??
9. Implement same for Word. MINIMAL boilerplate.
10.Test alternatives to the saved copy path (currently doing in same folder as original document)
FIXED 11.Should delete the copy created for upload.
IT'S OK :: 12.Server is using stub with Dummy token for login. Need to define logic with Arik / Emil.
FIXED 13.Save as opens the copy.

13. DONE: ERROR Handling. Currently there's no information displayed to the user regarding problems detected by the system. **TBD
14. DONE: INSTALL / Deployment method.
15. DONE: Show user messages about result of actions? (Upload fail / finish, Save upload fail/finish, etc...) **TBD
16. Shall we auto re-login if token expires and we still have email/pwd/account in memory?
17. Tell Emil and Arik about the option to do ClickOnce install. (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb772100.aspx)
18. Add Logging.
19. Changing company once logged in is impossible.
		FIXED: Ctrl + Click on Upload shows login again.
20. When file is not yet saved. Check if the default name of the file can be set while still in the RAM, not saved locally.
21. Expect from arik a different API for new file/vanilla file than for managed by Dokka file.
	** NOTE: REMIND Arik if not supplied.
22. Unsaved file: Add meta-data as long as there is not filename.
23. Expecct from upload of vanilla file response with document ID. 
	** NOTE: REMIND Arik if not supplied.
24. DONE: Make pwd field ***
25. DONE: Amazone Code Build: Check if it can build the VSTO solution. Check if it also knows how to build the Distribtion setup.exe / *.vsto files.

26. Flow:
	Create new file. Upload to Dokka (without saving locally). 
	Ctrl+S / "Save File" doesn't save the file locally, it only uploads it to dokka again.
	Attach document ID to metadata of file, for future save actions.
	If user does Save-As, don't upload the file anymore and delete the meta data.
	If this is a dokka managed file (detected through filename) save uploads to dokka + saves locally (current situation).
	NOTE: There are corner cases that don't need to be covered right now.
27. Setup environment in Google remote machine, so anybody can build it. Write instructions how to build this.

File Format:
Dokka#managed#file_mashebali_0123456789_configString


Dokka GIT repo token:
c82b9267b4101dc0eafb3c2cfcd8f3b68b838179


Tests:
1. No file / blank file / new file
2. Word and Excel
3. Upload same file / file with same name many times.
4. Test large files
5. Unsaved changes. NEED TO DEFINE BEHAVIOR.
6. Save uppon close app, check if upload succeeds
7. Check files with different names and valid and not valid dokka format.
8. Test file with more than one tab.
9. Uploaded a calendar with the first sheet empty. When looking at the web app, it shows a preview of the second seet, upside-down. Can be fixed using app-ui.
	When I download the file using the web-app and try opening it in Excel, I get an error: "The file is corrupted"

Fixes:
1. FIXED: Login UI status label messages cut. (Login required to upload a file to Dokka)
2. First time I click the Upload it seems to do nothing. - ** VERY HARD TO REPRODUCE **
3. FIXED: Update status when upload begins and when it ends / fails.
3. FIXED: Update status when login successful
4. FIXED: Change product name to something better than Excel_addin ...

================
Two Steps LOGIN:
1.
email: account1@dokka.me
pwd: qwerty1

2.
use token from first login
t1Token: Token
email: company.email9@foo.com
