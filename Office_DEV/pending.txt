Office Add-In:

. Sync issue. Upload works only on debug mode
. Get all slices into single bytearray before transmit
(look here for idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39695223/how-to-upload-a-local-word-docx-file-on-server-using-javascript)
. Fix filename through http headers if working with bytearray
. Fix crash after upload complete

. Do Post from form with input of type file (after fix of host: 0.0.0.0)
Then do multipart upload instead post of bytearray


Response should log all files uploaded

Check if office addin has key store (remembers username password)
Check if office plugin host and edge share the same key store (or password store) - 


VSTO

Flow:
1. User logs in and gets token.
2. Upload is done with token.
3. SHALL DO UPLOAD AFTER LOGIN?? CURRENTLY DOES OR LOGIN OR UPLOAD UPPON SAVE.
4. Need to persist username/password. No built in solution in windows such as keychain in mac.
5. Need to define together with Arik / Emil a way to validate file-token vs file-name vs client. 
	This way users cannot just edit the filename and upload another file just because it matches the regexp
6. *** MUST ***: Remove extra row added uppon upload for debug
7. Need to login again if Token expired.
8. Perist Token between Excel executions??
9. Implement same for Word. MINIMAL boilerplate.


File Format:
Dokka#managed#file_mashebali_0123456789_configString



Tests:
1. No file / blank file / new file
2. Word and Excel
3. Upload same file / file with same name many times.
4. Test large files
5. Unsaved changes. NEED TO DEFINE BEHAVIOR.
6. Save uppon close app, check if upload succeeds
7. Check files with different names and valid and not valid dokka format.
