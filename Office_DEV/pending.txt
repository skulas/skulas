Office Add-In:

1. Sync issue that works only on debug mode
2. Get all slices into single bityarray before transmit
(look here for idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39695223/how-to-upload-a-local-word-docx-file-on-server-using-javascript)
3. Do Post from form with input of type file (after fix of host: 0.0.0.0)
Thend do multipart upload instead post of bytearray
4. Fix filename through http headers if form / action post fails.
