Office Add-In:

. Sync issue. Upload works only on debug mode
. Get all slices into single bytearray before transmit
(look here for idea: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39695223/how-to-upload-a-local-word-docx-file-on-server-using-javascript)
. Fix filename through http headers if working with bytearray
. Fix crash after upload complete

. Do Post from form with input of type file (after fix of host: 0.0.0.0)
Then do multipart upload instead post of bytearray


Response should log all files uploaded

Check if office addin has key store (remembers username password)
Check if office plugin host and edge share the same key store (or password store) - 


VSTO
. On VSTO Application Add-In crashes when saving excel for the first time.



Flow:
1. User logs in and gets token.
2. Upload is done with token.




Tests:
1. No file / blank file / new file
2. Word and Excel
3. Upload same file / file with same name many times.
4. Test large files
5. Unsaved changes. NEED TO DEFINE BEHAVIOR.
